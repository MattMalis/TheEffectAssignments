# TheEffectAssignments

This is a repository of homework assignments that accompany [The Effect](https://theeffectbook.net) by Huntington-Klein. I ask that if you assign these in class, you at least include The Effect as a recommended title on the syllabus.

The list of questions for a given chapter is not super long, and many of the questions are open-ended in nature, so this really is more a set of homework assignments than a test bank or anything. But you could include these questions as part of an exam, certainly.

There are two types of assignments: regular homework quesions in Word format, and coding assignments in R, Stata, and Python, for which HTML assignment sheets and RMD code for the assignment sheets (and data) are available.

Answers are not included. If you would like the answer keys, please email nhuntington-klein@seattleu.edu from an .edu address with proof that you are an instructor of a course that uses or will use The Effect.

Assignments are available for all chapters (other than introductions, etc.).
